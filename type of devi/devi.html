                          <p>Sharada Navaratri is the most celebrated of the four Navaratri, named after Sharada which means autumn.
                               It commences on the first day (pratipada) of the bright fortnight of the lunar month of Ashvini.
                               The festival is celebrated for nine nights once every year during this month, which typically falls 
                               in the Gregorian months of September and October. The exact dates of the festival are determined 
                               according to the Hindu lunisolar calendar, and sometimes the festival may be held for a day more or
                                a day less depending on the adjustments for sun and moon movements and the leap year.
