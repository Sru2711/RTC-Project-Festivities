      <h2>History :</h2>
      <p class="p-3">Skandamātā (Sanskrit: स्कन्दमाता) is the fifth form of Hindu Goddess Durga.<br>
         Her name comes from Skanda, an alternate name for the war god Kartikeya, and Mātā, meaning mother.[1][2] As one of the Navadurga, the worship of Skandamātā takes place on the fifth day of Navaratri.<br>
         Her abode is in Vishuddha chakra.</p>
<h2>Worship :</h2>
<p class="p-3"> 
    The worship of Skandamātā purifies the heart of a devotee. While worshiping her, the devotee should have absolute control over his senses and mind. He should free himself from worldly bondage and worship her with a single-pointed devotion. Her worship is twice blessed.<br>
     When the devotee worships her, Lord Skanda, her son in her lap, is automatically worshipped.</p>

  <h2>Temples :</h2>
  <p class="p-3">
    Skandamata Durga Temple is located at J.6/33, Jaitpura in Varanasi.
