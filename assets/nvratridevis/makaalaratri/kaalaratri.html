      <h2 class="inform" style="background-color:royalblue">History:</h2>
      <p class="p-2">Kalaratri (sometimes spelled Kaalratri) is the seventh of the nine forms of the Goddess Durga, known as the Navadurga. She is first referenced in the Durga Saptashati, Chapters 81-93 of the Markandeya Purana, the earliest known literature on the Goddess Durga.<br>
         Kalaratri is widely regarded as one of the many destructive forms of the Mother Goddess, which include Kali, Mahakali, Bhadrakali, Bhairavi, Mrityu, Rudrani, Chamunda, Chandi and Durga.</p>
<h2 class="inform" style="background-color:royalblue">Worship:</h2>
<p class="p-2"> 
    One of the earlier references to Goddess Kaalratri is found in the famous epic, the Mahabharata (dated between 3137 BC - 3067 BC), specifically in the Sauptika Parva (Book of Sleeping), the tenth book of eighteen forming the full epic. <br>
    The context of her appearance in this portion of the epic occurs at the end of the historic battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas. After the historic battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas had come to an end, Dronacharya, a warrior on the Kaurava side, had been tricked into surrendering to the Pandavas, thus accepting his defeat. <br>
    His son Ashwatthama was determined to avenge the death of his father.</p>
