      <h2>History :</h2>
      <p class="p-3">Shailaputri is the Adi parasakti, who was born in the house of King of Mountains “Parvat Raj Himalaya”. The name “Shailaputri” literally means the daughter (putri) of mountain (shaila). Variously known as Sati Bhavani, Parvati or Hemavati, the daughter of Himavat - the king of the Himalayas.<br>

        The embodiment of the power of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, she rides a bull and carries a trident and a lotus in her two hands. In previous birth, she was daughter of Daksha, Sati.[5] Once Daksha had organized a big Yagna and did not invite Shiva. But Sati being obstinate, reached there. Thereupon Daksha insulted Shiva. Sati could not tolerate the insult of husband and burnt herself in the fire of Yagna. In other birth, she became the daughter of Himalaya in the name of Parvati - Hemavati and married Shiva. As per Upanishad, she had torn the egotism of Indra, etc. Devtas. Being ashamed they bowed and prayed that, "In fact, thou are Shakti, we all - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are capable by getting Shakti from you."<br>
        
        In some scriptures like Shiva Purana and Devi-Bhagavata Purana, the story of Mother Goddess is written as follows: Maa Bhagwati in her earlier birth was born as a daughter of Daksha Prajapati. Then her name was Sati and she was married to Lord Shiva. But in a sacrificial ceremony organized by her father Prajapati Daksha, her body was burned in the yogic fire, because she could not bear the insult of her husband Lord Shiva by her father Prajapati Daksha in the sacrificial ceremony.<br>
        
        In her next birth she became Goddess Parvati, the daughter of Parvat Raj Himalaya. Other avatar of navadurga is the incarnation of mother Parvati, she also incarnated her as 32 vidyas, who was again known as Hemavati. In her Hemavati aspect, she defeated all prominent gods. Like her previous birth, in this life also Maa Shailaputri (Parvati) married Lord Shiva.[6]</p>
<h2>Worship :</h2>
<p class="p-3"> 
  The puja begins with Ghatasthapana, a ritual that symbolises women power.[7] The Ghatasthapana puja is done by using puja items that are considered holy and symbolic. A shallow pan like utensil made of clay is used as base. Three layers of mud and Sapta Dhanya/Navadhanya seeds are then scattered in the pan. After that little bit of water is needed to be sprinkled so that seeds get enough moisture. Then, a Kalasha is filled with Ganga jal. Supari, a few coins, Akshat (raw rice mixed with turmeric powder) and Durva grass are put in water. After this, five leaves of the mango tree are put around the neck of the Kalash, which is then covered by placing a coconut.</p>
