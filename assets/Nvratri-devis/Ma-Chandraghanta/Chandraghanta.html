      <h2>History :</h2>
      <p class="p-2">Chandraghanta is the third form of Goddess Durga . <br>
        Her name Chandra-Ghanta, means "one who has a half-moon shaped like a bell. Her third eye is always opened and she is always ready for war against demons". <br>
        She is also known as Chandrakhanda, Chandika or Rannchandi. Her worship takes place on the third day of Navaratri (the nine divine nights of Navadurga). <br>
        She is believed to reward people with her grace, bravery and courage. By her grace, all the sins, distresses, physical sufferings, mental tribulations and ghostly hurdles of the devotees are eradicated. It also represents her married form.</p>
<h2>Worship :</h2>

  The devotees who adore and worship Chandraghanta develop an aura of divine splendor. Chandraghanta is ready to destroy the wicked, but to her devotees she is a kind and compassionate mother showering peace and prosperity. During the battle between her and the demons, the thunderous sound produced by her bell is known to have paralyzed and stunned the demons. She is ever ready to fight which shows her eagerness to destroy the foes of her devotees so that they may live in peace and prosperity.[1] Her abode is in Manipura chakra.</p>
