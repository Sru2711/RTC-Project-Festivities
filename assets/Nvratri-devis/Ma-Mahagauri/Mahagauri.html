      <h2>History :</h2>
      <p class="p-3">Mahagauri (Sanskrit: महागौरी, IAST: Mahāgaurī) is the eighth avatar of Durga and amongst the Navadurgas. Mahagauri is worshipped on the eighth day of Navaratri. According to Hinduism, Goddess Mahagauri has the power to fulfill all the desires of her devotees. The one who worships the goddess, gets relief from all the sufferings in life.<br>
        Mahagauri has four arms. Her right arm is in the pose of allaying fear and right lower hand holds a trident in it. She holds a tambourine in her left upper arm and the lower one is in the form of a blessing.</p>
<h2>Worship :</h2>
<p class="p-3"> 
    The story of Mahagauri's origins is as follows: The demons Shumbha and Nishumbha could only be killed by a virgin, unmarried form of Parvati. Hence, as advised by Brahma, Shiva repeatedly called Parvati as "Kali" for no reason, in a rather mocking way. Parvati was agitated by this teasing, so she performed severe penance to Brahma so as to get a golden complexion. Brahma explained his inability to grant her a boon and instead requested her to stop her penance and slay the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha.<br>
     Parvati agreed and went to take a bath in the Ganga river in Himalaya.</p>
